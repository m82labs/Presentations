#### No more flicker
# - Don't clear the host, just draw over what was there
#   - Reset text cursor to 0,0
#   - Draw blanks to fill the screen
#   - Reset the cursor again
#   - Write out the data we want to see
# - Hide the cursor just before redraw, this removes flickering artifacts as the
#   cursor moves
# - Storing the output in a variable first cuts out "processing" time in the
#   middle of the draw
